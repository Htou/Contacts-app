# Contacts-app
A Jetbrains Academy Project

An object oriented project that I have made with the help tests of Jetbrains Academy Java track.

Todo:
-Write inheritence mechanisms
-Add the ability to specify details in your contacts (for example, gender) and to create contacts and addresses of organizations.
-Implement polymorphism and built-in functions
-Fix code and make it possible to search for contacts.
